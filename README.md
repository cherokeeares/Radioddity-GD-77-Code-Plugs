<BR /><BR />
As a reminder,
<BR />
You update firmware by powering off radio, plugging in cable.
<BR />
Press and hold the two small square buttons on the left hand side of the radio, then power on the radio. You do not need to select a com port. No driver is needed.
<BR />
You update the code plug by just plugging the cable into the radio with it turned on, and push write. Pretty slick.
